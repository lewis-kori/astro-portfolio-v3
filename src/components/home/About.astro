          <p>
            I am an entrepreneur focused on building products, platforms, and
            companies that compound over time. My work sits at the intersection
            of technology, product, and business strategy, with a bias toward
            ownership, long-term thinking, and execution.
          </p>

          <p>
            I started my career deep in software engineering, where I learned
            how systems fail, scale, and succeed in the real world. Over time,
            my role expanded beyond code into product design, infrastructure,
            analytics, and ultimately company building. That progression shapes
            how I operate today: I think in systems, but I act through products.
          </p>

          <p>
            I currently build and operate multiple ventures, including
            Inflection Studio and Desturi, while advising founders and
            leadership teams on critical product and technology decisions. I am
            selective about where I spend time and energy, preferring problems
            that require judgment, not just effort.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am interested in businesses that value trust, clarity, and
            durability over speed for its own sake. I optimise for leverage,
            learning and compounding outcomes rather than short-term wins.

                I design, build, and operate digital products from concept to
                market. This includes defining product strategy, assembling
                teams, shipping platforms, and iterating based on real-world
                usage.

                Through essays and my newsletter, I explore edge cases in
                technology, business, and human decision-making. Writing is a
                tool for thinking clearly and sharing patterns learned through
                building.
