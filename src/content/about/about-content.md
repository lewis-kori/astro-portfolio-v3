title: About Lewis Kori
subtitle: Entrepreneur, Operator, and Builder of Systems
---

I am an entrepreneur focused on building products, platforms, and companies that compound over time. My work sits at the intersection of technology, product, and business strategy, with a bias toward ownership, long-term thinking, and execution.

I started my career deep in software engineering, where I learned how systems fail, scale, and succeed in the real world. Over time, my role expanded beyond code into product design, infrastructure, analytics, and ultimately company building. That progression shapes how I operate today: I think in systems, but I act through products.

I currently build and operate multiple ventures, including [Inflection Studio](https://inflectionstudio.io/), while advising founders and leadership teams on critical product and technology decisions. I am selective about where I spend time and energy, preferring problems that require judgment, not just effort.

I am interested in businesses that value trust, clarity, and durability over speed for its own sake. I optimise for leverage, learning and compounding outcomes rather than short-term wins.

## What I Do

### Venture Building

I design, build, and operate digital products from concept to market. This includes defining product strategy, assembling teams, shipping platforms, and iterating based on real-world usage.

### Advisory & Strategy

I work with founders and leadership teams navigating product, technology, and growth decisions. Engagements are selective and focused on clarity rather than execution volume.

### Writing & Thought Work

Through essays and my newsletter, I explore edge cases in technology, business, and human decision-making. Writing is a tool for thinking clearly and sharing patterns learned through building.
