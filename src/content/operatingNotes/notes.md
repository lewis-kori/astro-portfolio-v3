## Current Focus

I'm channeling my energy into work that compounds over time. Right now, that means:

- **Building and scaling product-led platforms** with institutional use cases
- **Advising venture capital firms** on technology strategy, platform tooling, and brand positioning
- **Designing systems** that balance automation, AI, and human judgment
- **Writing to clarify thinking**, not to perform expertise

---

## What I'm Actively Building

These are the projects where I'm spending my time:

- **Inflection Studio**: a systems-led digital consultancy
- **Internal tooling and frameworks** that reduce execution friction

---

## What I Say No To

Saying no is as important as saying yes. I avoid:

- Short-term consulting without ownership or leverage
- Projects driven primarily by hype or trend cycles
- Over-engineered solutions that fail under real-world constraints

---

## How I Make Decisions

My decision-making framework:

- **Favor durability over speed** — build things that last
- **Optimize for compounding advantage** — small wins that stack
- **Treat technology as infrastructure, not identity** — tools serve purpose
- **Use AI where it improves signal, not noise** — augment, don't automate blindly

---

## How to Work With Me

I'm selective about collaborations, but open to the right ones:

- **As a builder**: through the companies I operate
- **As an advisor**: on selective, high-leverage engagements
- **As a collaborator**: where incentives and ambition are aligned
