## How I Support Funds

I work with venture capital firms as an operator-informed advisor, helping funds strengthen their internal technology posture, portfolio support capabilities, and external brand narrative.

My work is shaped by hands-on experience building and operating platforms, not abstract frameworks. This allows me to bridge the gap between investment theses and execution realities.

The firms I work with aren't looking for generic consulting—they want someone who's been in the weeds, who understands the messy middle between strategy and shipping, and who can speak both to LPs and portfolio engineering teams.

## Typical Areas of Engagement

**Technology strategy and infrastructure guidance** for funds and portfolio companies  
Most funds know they need better tech. Few know where to start. I help clarify what actually matters, what can wait, and what's just noise.

**Evaluation of product and engineering maturity during diligence**  
When you're writing a check, you need to know if the team can execute. I assess technical depth, product thinking, and organizational readiness—the stuff that doesn't show up in pitch decks.

**Design of platform tooling to support founders post-investment**  
The best funds don't just deploy capital—they build infrastructure that helps their portfolio win. I design systems, tools, and frameworks that scale across multiple companies.

**Brand and digital positioning for funds and advisory arms**  
How a fund presents itself matters. I work on shaping narrative, refining digital presence, and ensuring that positioning aligns with the actual value being delivered.

**Long-term roadmap thinking for technology-enabled value creation**  
Where most advisory stops at tactical fixes, I focus on how technology becomes a lever for sustainable advantage—both for the fund and its portfolio.

## Relevant Experience

This work draws directly from engagements with:

**Mayfair Capital** — advising on digital modernization, internal tooling, and technology-driven operational clarity  
Helped the team rethink how they structure their technical operations and communicate value to stakeholders.

**Mayfair Consulting** — aligning brand, systems, and communication with institutional expectations  
Worked on positioning, messaging, and ensuring that external presentation matched internal capability.

**Amiccii** — supporting platform thinking, product structure, and brand coherence in a growth-stage environment  
Contributed to product roadmap clarity, platform architecture decisions, and go-to-market refinement.

Across these engagements, the focus has been consistent: reduce friction, improve signal, and build systems that scale with the fund's ambition.

## Engagement Model

I work best with funds that:

- Take a long-term view on platform value
- Want to offer meaningful operational support to founders
- Value clarity over complexity in technology decisions

Engagements are typically advisory in nature, structured around clear outcomes rather than open-ended commitments.

If you're building infrastructure that matters, supporting founders who ship, or refining how your fund operates and communicates—let's talk.
